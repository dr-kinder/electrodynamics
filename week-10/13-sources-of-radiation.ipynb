    "# Dipole Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Any accelerating charge produces electromagnetic radiation.  If the charges in a neutral object — like an atom or a radio antenna — are undergoing periodic motion, we can approximate the system as an **oscillating electric dipole**.  As discussed in Chapter 9 of _CER_ or [Chapter 28 of the Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_28.html), the __radiation field__ at point $\\vec{r}$ in the $xz$-plane far from a dipole oscillating along the $z$-axis at the origin is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\n",
    "\\, \\omega^2 p_0 \\sin \\theta\n",
    "\\, \\dfrac{\\cos \\omega(t - r/c)}{r}\n",
    "\\, (\\hat{e}_x \\cos \\theta - \\hat{e}_z \\sin \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to tame this expression and create a movie of an oscillating electric field.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| $\\omega$ | angular frequency of oscillation |\n",
    "| $p_0$ | maximum dipole moment |\n",
    "| $c$ | speed of light |\n",
    "| $r$ | distance from origin to point of interest |\n",
    "| $t$ | current time |\n",
    "| $\\theta$ | angle from $y$-axis to point of interest |\n",
    "\n",
    "The final term in parentheses is a unit vector that gives the direction of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warm Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to watch the electromagnetic waves propagate outward from the dipole as it oscillates.  This means we need to choose the time increments and spatial grid of points appropriately.  We need to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the duration of the simulation if we want to watch 10 complete cycles of oscillation.\n",
    "    - 700 nm => 428 THz => 2.33 fs\n",
    "    - 2.33 fs x 10 = 23.3 fs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the size of the grid if we want to see at least 5 wavelengths in each direction.\n",
    "    - 700 nm x 5 = 3.5 um\n",

    "- Determine a reasonable time increment `dt` and grid spacing `dx` for simulating red light with a wavelength of $700 \\ {\\tt nm}$.\n",
    "    - 1% x 2.33 fs = 23.3 as\n",
    "    - 1% x 700 nm = 7 nm\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have the computer hardware of lifespan to simulate a 1 billion by 1 billion grid of points for 10 billion time steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "___Solution:___\n",
    "\n",
    "- The wavelength of the light is $\\lambda = 7.0 \\, 10^{-7} \\ {\\tt m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The period of a wave is $T = \\dfrac{1}{f} = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{c}$.  For red light, this works out to $T \\approx 2.335 \\cdot 10^{-15} \\ {\\tt s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Dimensional Analysis:___\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are very small, and the frequency and speed of light are very large. We might run into roundoff error if we are not careful.  Instead, let's choose our units so that numerical values are on the order of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that we can rewrite the argument of the cosine function as follows:\n",
    "$$\\omega(t - R/c) = 2\\pi \\left(\\dfrac{t}{T} - \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n",
    "If we measure time in femtoseconds and distance in micrometers, all numbers in this expression will be of order 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can now rewrite the expression for the electric field as follows:\n",
    "$$\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t)\n",
    "= E_0 \\, \\dfrac{\\lambda}{r} \\, \\cos 2\\pi \\left( \\dfrac{t}{T} - \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)\n",
    "\\, (\\hat{e}_x \\cos \\theta - \\hat{e}_z \\sin \\theta)  \\sin \\theta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$E_0 = \\dfrac{\\omega^2 p_0}{\\lambda c^2} = 4 \\pi^2 \\dfrac{p_0}{\\lambda^3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different values of $E_0$ change the overall magnitude of the electric field, but not the relative size of the components at different points.  Thus, we can set $E_0 = 1$ during the calculation, and we can restore the units if we need to compute forces at another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of dimensional analysis can greatly simplify codiing and often leads to more accurate results because you do not \"forget\" a factor $10^9$ somewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make a movie!"

    "From doing HAM radio, I actually know what the field of a dipole should look like! Although that is generally graphed in terms of intestity around the antenna to determine what angle most of the power is being sent out at. That being said, for the electric and magentic field, I think the electric field will point radially from the dipole and grow and shrink with the change in current. I don't know if this field is being modeled with some potential or current density function on the y axis, but wherever the peaks of that function are will either be the maximum or minimum values of magnetic or electric field. The fields will be greatest closest to the antenna, and degrade as they get further away."

Along the axis of the dipole, there is a conical shape in which there is very little change in the electric field.

I suppose if we were to actually look at the emitted wave in 3D, each \"block\" of electric field would appear like spherical shells. The sperical shells move away from the dipole with the same phase and frequency but degrading amplitude. Since nothing except the amplitude of this wave changes over the distance the wave travels in the plane of the dipole, we can say this wave is a plane wave."

    "Well... I got something! The first sign I changed was the pz and px signs. By switching the negative to the z component, I was able to get the dipole to start to rotate in the opposite direction. That was pretty simple, so by the same logic I switched the signs of the Ex and Ez components. This resulted in the dipole spinning the correct way but the field was wrong. Next, I tried changing different conbinations of the magnitudes and x and z components to see if I could get something that worked. By changing the Ez component to positive and changing theta to negative, I got the correct answer. I did end up only adding two minus signs (although I think I took away more). The field looks wierd, like it got more dense near the dipole. I don't know if this is an issue with the calculations or something wrong, but further away from the dipole the field looked the same"

    "I noticed the circle around the dipole turned into more of an ellipse. That being said, after I tried to change some things around the notebook stopped working! I went back to Dr. Kinder's GitHub page to see if I could find the original code, but even after changing it back it doesn't seem to be working. Well the original still works but it won't let me set both the E2 and px value to be multiplied by 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "After messing around with it for a bit, I found that I had set the Ex component to half the original value. Even then, now I don't see any change in the field when E2 is set to half the value. I really don't know what's going on here. I would have assumed that the first picture I saw with the ellipse field around the dipole would be correct, but shouldn't the ellipse spin with the dipole? I don't know, I would imagine you'd end up with two waves, one with a frequency of the spinnign dipole and one with the frequency of the wave cased by the change in the dipole. "

    "I really enjoyed this last notebook, I think that overall it illustrated what the electric field looks like around a radiating element. I wish there was a little better connection between the model and an actual antenna, since it's not like I can physically build a 700 nm halfwave dipole. I guess this would model somthing like an atom which has an electron continually jumping between energy levels. The part where we spin the dipole might represent a atom spinning while it moves. The chaning in the length of the dipole while it spins might represent contraction or stretching of bond lengths as it spins. These were all things I was thinking about, but I wonder how accurate that might be? How could this model be applied to something like flourescent chemicals or LEDs or anything else that produces light? Not only that, but what insights could we gain for designing much larger systems like radio all the way up to microwave antennas. The most interesting part of this assignment was playing around with the rotating antenna, but I couldn't get certain sections of that part to work. It was kind of frusterating, but at the same time I feel like I got a very good understanding of how the system worked in python. The most difficult part of this assignment was trying to get the graph to work with the half valued fields and dipole in the rotating section. I could not figure out why it worked the first time I tried it but after I changed the magnitude it stopped working! I've run into issues with Python where after changing one thing and then going back to the first code breaks it for some reason and I don't know if it's a problem with Jupyter or Colab or whether I've screwed up code that bad. Anyways, I didn't know how to fix it, so I got the first part where the dipole worked to go, and I got one look at the changing field but nothing after that. I really apologize, I hate to leave stuff like that but this has to get in.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more general point about the notebooks, I feel that they were very helpful, and I learned a lot about not only Python but also visualizing what fields look like. I really liked the Fenics stuff, as much as it challenged me (to put it in polite terms) and I feel like it was better than the book for describing things like vector and scalar potential with the heatmaps. I think my favorite notebooks were the magnetic field around an iron core and the waveguide one. Really great job with the class, I've learned more in this class than any class I think I've ever taken at this school. Both professors really care about the students and are extremely knowledgable, which made for an organized and open learning environment."
